    Insert a CRM client into ICRM instance and transfer the instance to a Component function. 
    
    Component function
    --
    Component function can be reused by different agnostic resources sharing the same `ICRM Specification`.  
    Common Component function is expected to have inputs:  
    - `ICRM connected to CRM`
    - `Component args`  
    The `ICRM connected to CRM` is an ICRM instance having a specific CRM client.
    This `ICRM` will direct the Component to a CRM Server and make it calculate with specified resource behind the CRM.
    
    Component-related runtime
    --
    The Component-related runtime does not know which `CRM client` the Component's ICRM needs until a specified request coming.  
    Therefore, when the runtime tries to invoke a Component function, it will call from the following arguments:  
    - `Component args`
    - `[CRM address (provided by request)]`
    - `[CRM client (provided for test)]`
    
    instead of expected inputs of Component function.

    - Use current_client from runtime context if available (with statement)
    - Use provided crm_connection if available
    - Create new client from crm_address if provided
    
    Supports both @connect and @connect() usage patterns.
