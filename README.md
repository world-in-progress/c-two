C-Two is a **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework** that enables resource-oriented classes to be remotely invoked across different processes or machines. It is specifically designed for distributed resource computation systems. The framework provides a structured abstraction layer that enables remote method calling between **Components** and **Core Resource Models (CRMs)** with automatic serialization and protocol-agnostic communication.

## What's New in v0.2.6
- More convenient implementation for Core Resource Models (no need to inherit from a base ICRM class and decorate with `@iicrm`).
- More specific ICRM identification with namespace and versioning support.
- Servers now support graceful shutdown with cleanup callbacks.

## WIP
- Support for function validation between CRM and ICRM.
- Built-in default serialization for common data classes (replacing python's pickle).

## Framework Overview

**The design philosophy of C-Two is not to define services, but to empower resources.**

In scientific computation, resources that encapsulate complex state and domain-specific operations need to be organized into cohesive units or interaction models. We call these resource-oriented abstractions **Core Resource Models (CRMs)**. From a business logic perspective, applications care more about how to interact with resources and implement high-level logic, rather than where the resources are located or where they originate. We call these resource consumers **Components**. C-Two provides location transparency and uniform resource access for CRMs, allowing components to interact with them as if they were local objects. This approach is particularly valuable for geographic information systems, scientific computing, and other domains that require persistent resource management with distributed access patterns.

C-Two addresses the complexity of distributed computing by implementing a clear separation of concerns through interface-based programming and automatic type marshalling. The framework enables developers to write distributed applications using familiar local programming patterns.

This framework tries to transform isolated computational models into reusable, network-addressable assets, fostering long-term knowledge accumulation over short-term service proliferation.

### Core Architectural Principles

- **Resource-Oriented Design**: Focus on stateful computational resources rather than stateless function calls
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean separation between interface definitions (ICRM) and implementations (CRM)
- **Protocol Abstraction**: Transport-agnostic communication supporting multiple protocols (Thread, Memory, IPC, TCP, HTTP)

## Architecture

The framework implements a three-tier architecture:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/world-in-progress/c-two/main/doc/images/architecture.png" alt="Architecture" width="1500" />

### Component Layer
Client-side computational units that consume remote resources through Interface of Core Resource Models (ICRM), providing network transparency for distributed operations.

### CRM Layer
Server-side CRMs that maintain persistent state and implement domain-specific resource management, exposed through standardized ICRM interfaces.

### Transport Layer
Protocol-agnostic communication infrastructure supporting multiple transport mechanisms (Thread, Memory, IPC, TCP, HTTP) with automatic protocol detection, connection management, and message serialization. The framework automatically selects the appropriate transport implementation based on the address scheme.

## Technical Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.10
- Type annotation support
- Network connectivity for distributed deployment (TCP, HTTP protocols)

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Resource Model Implementation (CRM)

Implement the CRM as a regular Python class that maintains resource state and implements domain-specific logic.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class GridAttribute:
    level: int
    global_id: int
    elevation: float

# Define CRM ###########################################################

class Grid:
    def __init__(self, epsg: int, bounds: list[float], first_size: list[float], subdivide_rules: list[list[int]]):
        # Resource initialization
        pass
    
    def get_grid_infos(self, level: int, global_ids: list[int]) -> list[GridAttribute]:
        # Implement grid information retrieval logic
        pass
    
    def subdivide_grids(self, levels: list[int], global_ids: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        # Implement grid subdivision algorithm
        pass
    
    def delete_grids(self, levels: list[int], global_ids: list[int]) -> None:
        # Implement grid deletion logic
        pass

    def terminate(self):
        # Implement resource cleanup logic
        pass

```

### 2. Interface Definition (ICRM)

Define remote interfaces using the `@icrm` decorator to establish contracts for distributed communication.
You only need to expose the CRM methods that will be accessed remotely, not all methods.

```python
import c_two as cc
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class GridAttribute:
    level: int
    global_id: int
    elevation: float

# Define ICRM ##############################################

@cc.icrm(namespace='cc.demo', version='0.1.0')
class IGrid:
    def get_grid_infos(self, level: int, global_ids: list[int]) -> list[GridAttribute]:
        """Retrieve grid information for specified level and identifiers"""
        ...
    
    def subdivide_grids(self, levels: list[int], global_ids: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        """Perform grid subdivision operations"""
        ...
```

### 3. Custom Data Type Definition (Optional)

Define serializable data structures using the `@transferable` decorator with custom serialization logic.
In this example, we modify `GridAttribute` and create `GridAttributes` in the ICRM file to use Apache Arrow for efficient serialization.

```python
import c_two as cc
import pyarrow as pa

# @transferable will decorate the class as data class automatically
@cc.transferable
class GridAttribute:
    level: int
    global_id: int
    elevation: float
    
    def serialize(data: 'GridAttribute') -> bytes:
        schema = pa.schema([
            pa.field('level', pa.int32()),
            pa.field('global_id', pa.int32()),
            pa.field('elevation', pa.float64())
        ])
        table = pa.Table.from_pylist([data.__dict__], schema=schema)
        return serialize_from_table(table)
    
    def deserialize(arrow_bytes: bytes) -> 'GridAttribute':
        row = deserialize_to_rows(arrow_bytes)[0]
        return GridAttribute(**row)

@cc.transferable
class GridAttributes:
    """
    A collection of GridAttribute objects with built-in serialization capabilities.
    
    The C-Two framework automatically handles serialization / deserialization
    when this type is detected as a parameter or return type in CRM methods
    (e.g., the return type of Grid.get_grid_infos()).
    """
    def serialize(data: list[GridAttribute]) -> bytes:
        schema = pa.schema([
            pa.field('attribute_bytes', pa.list_(pa.binary())),
        ])
        data_dict = {
            'attribute_bytes': [GridAttribute.serialize(grid) for grid in data]
        }
        table = pa.Table.from_pylist([data_dict], schema=schema)
        return serialize_from_table(table)

    def deserialize(arrow_bytes: bytes) -> list[GridAttribute]:
        table = deserialize_to_table(arrow_bytes)
        grid_bytes = table.column('attribute_bytes').to_pylist()[0]
        return [GridAttribute.deserialize(grid_byte) for grid_byte in grid_bytes]

# Define ICRM ##############################################

@cc.icrm(namespace='cc.demo', version='0.1.0')
class IGrid:
    def get_grid_infos(self, level: int, global_ids: list[int]) -> list[GridAttribute]:
        """Retrieve grid information for specified level and identifiers"""
        ...
    
    def subdivide_grids(self, levels: list[int], global_ids: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        """Perform grid subdivision operations"""
        ...

# Helpers ##################################################

def serialize_from_table(table: pa.Table) -> bytes:
    sink = pa.BufferOutputStream()
    with pa.ipc.new_stream(sink, table.schema) as writer:
        writer.write_table(table)
    binary_data = sink.getvalue().to_pybytes()
    return binary_data

def deserialize_to_rows(serialized_data: bytes) -> dict:
    buffer = pa.py_buffer(serialized_data)
    with pa.ipc.open_stream(buffer) as reader:
        table = reader.read_all()
    return table.to_pylist()
```

### 4. Server Deployment

Deploy the CRM as a networked service with automatic protocol detection.
Services are accessible only through the defined ICRM interfaces.

```python
import c_two as cc
from crm import Grid
from icrm import IGrid

# Resource initialization and server configuration
grid = Grid(epsg=2326, bounds=[...], first_size=[64.0, 64.0], subdivide_rules=[...])

# Create server configuration
config = cc.rpc.ServerConfig(
    name='GridProcessor',
    crm=grid,
    icrm=IGrid,
    on_shutdown=grid.terminate,
    bind_address='thread://grid_processor',     # thread server (in-process, thread-safe communication)
    # bind_address='memory://grid_processor',   # memory server (shared memory, high-performance local communication)
    # bind_address='ipc:///tmp/grid_processor', # IPC server (inter-process communication for Unix-like systems, local machine)
    # bind_address='tcp://localhost:5555',      # TCP server (network-based, cross-machine)
    # bind_address='http://localhost:8000',     # HTTP server (web-compatible, cross-platform)
)

# Init server
server = cc.rpc.Server(config)

# Same server lifecycle management regardless of protocol
server.start()
print('CRM server is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.')
try:
    # Wait for server termination with optional timeout
    server.wait_for_termination(timeout=10)
    print('Timeout reached, stopping CRM server...')
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print('Keyboard interrupt received, stopping CRM server...')
finally:
    server.stop()
    print('CRM server stopped.')
```

### 5. Client Implementation

The framework provides seamless, protocol-transparent connectivity to CRM services.

#### Script-Based Component Approach
```python
# Thread connection
with cc.compo.runtime.connect_crm('thread://grid_processor', IGrid) as grid:
    infos = grid.get_grid_infos(1, [0, 1, 2])
    keys = grid.subdivide_grids([1, 1], [0, 1])

# Memory connection
with cc.compo.runtime.connect_crm('memory://grid_processor', IGrid) as grid:
    infos = grid.get_grid_infos(1, [0, 1, 2])
    keys = grid.subdivide_grids([1, 1], [0, 1])

# IPC connection
with cc.compo.runtime.connect_crm('ipc:///tmp/grid_processor', IGrid) as grid:
    infos = grid.get_grid_infos(1, [0, 1, 2])
    keys = grid.subdivide_grids([1, 1], [0, 1])

# TCP connection
with cc.compo.runtime.connect_crm('tcp://localhost:5555', IGrid) as grid:
    infos = grid.get_grid_infos(1, [0, 1, 2])
    keys = grid.subdivide_grids([1, 1], [0, 1])

# HTTP connection
with cc.compo.runtime.connect_crm('http://localhost:8000', IGrid) as grid:
    infos = grid.get_grid_infos(1, [0, 1, 2])
    keys = grid.subdivide_grids([1, 1], [0, 1])

print(f'Retrieved {len(infos)} grid attributes, generated {len(keys)} subdivisions')
```

#### Function-Based Component Approach
```python
@cc.runtime.connect
def process_grids(grid: IGrid, target_level: int) -> list[str]:
    """Reusable component for grid processing operations"""
    infos = grid.get_grid_infos(target_level, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    candidates = [info.global_id for info in infos if hasattr(info, 'elevation') and info.elevation > 0]
    return grid.subdivide_grids([target_level] * len(candidates), candidates)

# Protocol is automatically determined by the address
result = process_grids(1, crm_address='thread://grid_processor')      # use Thread
result = process_grids(1, crm_address='memory://grid_processor')      # use Memory
result = process_grids(1, crm_address='ipc:///tmp/grid_processor')    # use IPC
result = process_grids(1, crm_address='tcp://localhost:5555')         # use TCP
result = process_grids(1, crm_address='http://localhost:8000')        # use HTTP

# OR ##################################################

# Using a context manager with automatic protocol detection
with cc.compo.connect_crm('thread://grid_processor'):
    result = process_grids(1)
```

### 6. External System Integration

Integrate with external systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import compo  # module containing function-based components

mcp = FastMCP('GridAgent', instructions=cc.mcp.CC_INSTRUCTION)
cc.mcp.register_mcp_tools_from_compo_module(mcp, compo)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    mcp.run()
```
